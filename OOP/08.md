# Choosing Between Composition and Inheritance in Object-Oriented Design

Composition and inheritance fundamental concepts for designing relationships between classes. Each approach offers distinct advantages and is suitable for different scenarios. This post will explore the differences between composition and inheritance, discuss when to use each, and provide examples and best practices to guide your design decisions.

## Difference Between Composition and Inheritance

-   **Composition:** Composition involves creating complex objects by combining simpler objects. It describes a "has-a" relationship, where one class contains an instance of another class.
-   **Inheritance:** Inheritance involves creating new classes based on existing classes, establishing an "is-a" relationship where a subclass inherits properties and behaviors from a superclass.

### When to Use Each Approach

-   **Composition:**
    -   Use composition when a class contains objects of another class but does not inherit their interface or implementation.
    -   Prefer composition over inheritance to achieve greater flexibility and avoid the limitations of a rigid class hierarchy.

### PHP Example of Composition:

```php
<?php
class Engine {
    public function start() {
        echo "Engine started";
    }
}

class Car {
    private $engine;

    public function __construct() {
        $this->engine = new Engine();
    }

    public function startCar() {
        $this->engine->start();
    }
}

$car = new Car();
$car->startCar(); // Output: Engine started
?>
```

-   **Inheritance:**
    -   Use inheritance when a subclass logically extends a superclass and inherits its behavior.
    -   Prefer inheritance when you have a clear hierarchical relationship and want to reuse code from a superclass.

### PHP Example of Inheritance:

```php
<?php
class Animal {
    public function makeSound() {
        echo "Animal makes a sound";
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    public function makeSound() {
        echo "Dog barks";
    }
}

$dog = new Dog();
$dog->makeSound(); // Output: Dog barks
?>
```

## Examples and Best Practices

### Best Practices:

-   **Composition:** Use interfaces or abstract classes to define contracts between classes involved in composition.
-   **Inheritance:** Favor composition over deep class hierarchies to avoid complexity and potential pitfalls like tight coupling.

## Wrapping Up

Composition and inheritance are valuable techniques for designing class relationships. By understanding their differences and knowing when to apply each, you can create well-structured and maintainable code that meets your design goals effectively.
